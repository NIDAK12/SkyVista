            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>When you buy a new home with SkyVista, you get greater peace of mind. Forget the leaky rooftops, bad plumbing, and foundational damage – Lennar’s homes are built to modern-day safety standards. Plus, your new home will come with select roof, structural, and appliance warranties you’ll only find when buying new.
                new homes come with modern insulation that can lead to lower energy costs. You can save additional money via efficient central air systems, new windows, and self-cleaning appliances — all grounded in the latest smart technology.
                Revamping an old home can come with a lot of risks. You could run into water damage, mold, and foundation issues, amongst other issues. A new home from Lennar can help minimize surprise costs. Open layouts come standard. And there’s no need for costly renovation projects such as bonus rooms, mudrooms, laundry rooms, or extra storage.
